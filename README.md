## Project Overview
This project involves:
- Manipulating a large dataset and building data pipelines.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and drawing statistical inferences.
- Modeling trends over time and performing feature engineering.
- Performing sentiment analysis on reviews to correlate ratings and sentiment scores.
- Using a gradient boosting algorithm to assess the credibility of reviews.

## Data Pipeline
The data pipeline includes:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathering Amazon review data.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and preprocessing text.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features to improve model accuracy.
4. **Data Storage:** Efficient storage and retrieval of processed data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Comprehensive EDA was performed to understand the dataset, including:
- Visualizing review distributions and trends over time.
- Analyzing the distribution of ratings and sentiment scores.
- Identifying patterns and anomalies in the data.

## Trend Modeling and Feature Engineering
Trend modeling and feature engineering involved:
- Identifying and modeling temporal trends in the data.
- Creating features such as review length, word count, and sentiment scores.
- Improving model interpretability and performance through engineered features.

## Sentiment Analysis
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were used to perform sentiment analysis:
- Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- Calculating sentiment scores for each review.
- Correlating sentiment scores with review ratings.

## Credibility Assessment Model
A gradient boosting algorithm was developed to assess review credibility:
- Training the model on labeled data.
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy and other metrics.
- Achieving an accuracy of 84.5% in predicting review credibility.

## Results
The project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using data analysis and machine learning to assess the credibility of Amazon reviews, achieving significant accuracy and insights into review authenticity.
